 - new color scheme that doesn't make people assume I'm a blind wombat.
 - more web20ish UI elements.  I like the default github scheme.
 - fix date presentation, mix of JS Date and SQL datetime (ewww).

more complicated UI things:
 - make all IPs hoverable or clickable to get whois info (pull github/vbfox?)
 - do the same for hostnames

data presentation thoughts:
 - rather than programmatically iterating fields and populating an empty div,
   have empty divs with tags indicating which fields go in them, and populate
   them when data arrives.  Or at least, replace structure-in-code with
   structured data.
